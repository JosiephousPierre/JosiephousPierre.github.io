            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Josiephous Pierre G. Dosdos, and I am 22 years old. 
                I live in Maco, Davao de Oro. I graduated from Maco Central Elementary 
                School during my elementary years. For junior high school, I completed my 
                education at Letran de Davao in Maco. Later, for my senior high school, I 
                graduated from Saint Mary's College of Tagum INC. Currently, I am a second-year 
                BSIT student at the University of Immaculate Conception. While I am still in the 
                process of developing my programming and website development skills, I firmly believe 
                that I will excel in these areas someday.

                The photo above is proof of my completion of the HTML activities so far. During these activities, 
                I've learned a lot, such as how to insert images in HTML, how to create paragraphs, how to make lists, 
                how to create tables, what are the attributes, and more. At first, it was challenging, but it has become enjoyable, and it gets easier 
                as time goes on once you understand the structure of HTML. Overall, the knowledge gained from these activities 
                is essential for creating websites.

                The photos above are proof of my completion of the CSS activities. During these activities, 
                I have learned a lot, especially when it comes to learning CSS on Codecademy, because it felt like 
                I needed to learn everything there. The topics covered include syntax and selectors, visual rules, 
                the box model, display and positioning, colors, and typography.
            </p>
            <p>
                For me, CSS is more challenging compared to HTML because, honestly, I struggle with design since 
                I have a limited imagination when it comes to designs. However, with the help of these activities, 
                my imagination about designing using CSS has expanded, and I've realized that I can create many designs 
                for my future website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, CSS is indeed more challenging than HTML, but it is satisfying and enjoyable when you can beautifully design your website.
